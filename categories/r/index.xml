      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Here! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share that plantTracker, an R package that I created as part of my PhD dissertation, is available to download from CRAN!
plantTracker provides several user-friendly functions that extract growth, survival, and competition information from repeatedly-sampled, fine-scale maps of organism occurence. We created these functions specifically to get competition and demographic data from repeatedly-mapped quadrats of perennial plants, but are excited for folks to come up with all sorts of creative applications for these functions!</description>
