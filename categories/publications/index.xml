      <title>plantTracker: An R package to translate maps of plant occurrence into demographic data</title>

      <description>Long-term demographic data are rare yet invaluable for conservation, management, and basic research on the underlying mechanisms of population and community dynamics. Historical and contemporary mapped datasets of plant location and basal area present a relatively untapped source of demographic records that, in some cases, span over 20 years of sequential data collection. However, these maps do not uniquely mark individual plants, making the process of collecting growth, survival, and recruitment data difficult.</description>

      <title>Demographic mechansims of persistence for the rare monocarpic perennial *Oenothera coloradensis*</title>

      <description>The persistence of naturally rare species has long been a motivating question for ecologists. Classical theory implies that community dynamics should be driven by common species, and that natural selection should not allow small populations of rare species to persist over long periods. And yet, a majority of the species found on earth are rare. Rare species contribute to diversity, community stability, and ecosystem function, and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain their persistence.</description>

      <title>Trait-mediated demographic response to drought in the Colorado shortgrass steppe</title>

      <description>A major goal in ecology is to make generalizable predictions of organism responses to environmental variation based on their traits. However, straightforward relationships between traits and fitness are rare and likely vary with environmental context. Characterizing how traits mediate demographic responses to the environment may enhance predictions of organism responses to global change.
In this project, we synthesized 15 years of demographic data and species-level traits in a shortgrass steppe to determine whether the effects of leaf and root traits on growth and survival depend on seasonal water availability.</description>

      <description>Overleaf 101 Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor that has a lot of great features including simultaneous editing by multiple authors, simple commenting and track changes, and excellent built-in version control. It is a bit different than Microsoft Word or Google Docs, but not by much! Here is a quick overview to help you figure out how (and why) to navigate and contribute to documents written on Overleaf.
Overleaf is LaTeX editor that is hosted online.</description>

      <title>plantTracker is published on CRAN!</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Here! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share that plantTracker, an R package that I created as part of my PhD dissertation, is available to download from CRAN!
plantTracker provides several user-friendly functions that extract growth, survival, and competition information from repeatedly-sampled, fine-scale maps of organism occurence. We created these functions specifically to get competition and demographic data from repeatedly-mapped quadrats of perennial plants, but are excited for folks to come up with all sorts of creative applications for these functions!</description>
