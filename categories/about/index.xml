      <description>I am currently a Postdoctoral research associate at the University of Wyoming as part of both the Weiss-Lehman lab group and the Modelscape consortium. I recieved my PhD in Ecology from the University of Wyoming in the Program in Ecology and Evolution and the Botany Department, where I worked with Dr. Daniel Laughlin.
I&amp;rsquo;m a plant ecologist excited about all sorts of questions, but am particularly interested in the impact of global change on the ecological processes that shape plant populations and communities.</description>
