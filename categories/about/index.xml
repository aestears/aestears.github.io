      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate in Ecology at the University of Wyoming in the Program in Ecology and the Botany Department. I am a plant ecologist excited about all sorts of plant and ecological questions, but am particularly interested the impact of global change on ecological processes in plant populations and communities. I use functional traits as tools to understand the mechanisms underlying plant responses to the environment, as well as to make predictions and draw conclusions about plant responses that aren&amp;rsquo;t restricted by taxonomy.</description>
