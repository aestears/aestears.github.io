    "body": "I am broadly interested in understanding how environmental variation determines where and when plants exists. I am particularly curious about how species' traits mediate the impact of climate variation on plant growth, survival, and reproduction (i.e fitness). Are certain morphological and or physiological characteristics important for predicting plant fitness in every setting? Or do different traits drive fitness differently in habitats with different limiting resources?\nTrait-mediated demographic response to drought in the Colorado shortgrass steppe Read more about this project here, in our paper published in Ecology.\nA major goal in ecology is to make generalizable predictions of organism responses to environmental variation based on their traits. However, straightforward relationships between traits and fitness are rare and likely vary with environmental context. Characterizing how traits mediate demographic responses to the environment may enhance predictions of organism responses to global change. In this project, we synthesized 15 years of demographic data and species-level traits in a shortgrass steppe to determine whether the effects of leaf and root traits on growth and survival depend on seasonal water availability.\nWe found that graminoids with more negative leaf turgor loss point (TLP), a physioloigcal trait that indicates the water potential at which a platn begins to wilt, and higher leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and root dry matter content (RDMC) had higher survival rates in drier years. Forbs demonstrated similar yet more variable responses. Graminoids grew larger in wetter years, regardless of traits. However, in both wet and dry years, graminoids with more negative TLP and higher LDMC and RDMC grew larger than less negative TLP and low LDMC and RDMC species. Traits significantly mediated the impact of drought on survival, but not growth, suggesting survival could be a stronger driver of speciesâ€™ drought response in this system. TLP predicted survival in drier years, but easier-to-measure LDMC and RDMC were equal or better predictors. These results advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which drought drives population dynamics, and show that abiotic context determines how traits drive fitness.\nStears, Alice E., Peter B.

Ecology. e3799. https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3799\nplantTracker R package Long-term demographic data are rare yet invaluable for conservation, management, and basic research on the underlying mechanisms of population and community dynamics. Historical mapped datasets of plant basal area present a relatively untapped source of demographic records that, in some cases, span over 20 years of sequential data collection. However, these maps did not uniquely mark individual plants, making the process of collecting growth, survival, and recruitment data more difficult. Recent efforts to translate paper maps of historical quadrats into shapefiles make it possible to use computer algorithms to track individuals through time and determine individual growth and survival. We created the plantTracker R package, which contains user-friendly functions to extract local neighborhood and demographic data from historical quadrat maps, as well as any other repeatedly sampled maps of stationary organisms. This package contains two primary functions: trackSpp(), which tracks individuals through time and assigns demographic data, as well as getNeighbors(), which calculates both within and between-species local neighborhood occupancy around each mapped individual. plantTracker also contains functions to estimate plot-level recruitment, calculate plot-level population growth rate, and create quadrat maps.\nTrait-mediated demographic response to drought across the western US Demographic mechansims of persistence for the rare monocarpic perennial Oenothera coloradensis The persistence of naturally rare species has long been a motivating question for ecologists. Classical theory implies that community dynamics should be driven by common species, and that natural selection should not allow small populations of rare species to persist over long periods. And yet, a majority of the species found on earth are rare. Rare species contribute to diversity, community stability, and ecosystem function, and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain their persistence. We used size-based integral projection models (IPMs) to examine the population dynamics of Oenothera coloradensis, a rare, endemic, monocarpic perennial forb, and determined whether any of five proposed demographic mechanisms for rare species persistence were acting in populations of this species. We also evaluated the importance of including a discrete seedbank stage in population models of this species, and simulated population growth under different climate scenarios to assess the persistence outlook for O. coloradensis populations.\nWe determined that the seedbank is important for O. coloradensis, and that including a seedbank stage in population models has a significant impact on modeled population growth rate. IPMs that included a size-based continuous state and discrete seedbank state indicated that neither negative density dependence, demographic compensation, vital rate buffering, spatial asynchrony, nor fine-scale source-sink dynamics are acting to maintain the positive growth we observed in O. coloradensis subpopulations. Instead, we propose that high micro-site abundance allows this species to sidestep the demographic and genetic challenges of small population size that rare species typically face. Simulations indicate that this species is likely to persist in the future, barring the negative impacts of habitat loss.\n",

    "body": "I recently recieved my PhD in Ecology at the University of Wyoming in the Program in Ecology and the Botany Department, where I worked with Dr. Daniel Laughlin. I\u0026rsquo;m a plant ecologist excited about all sorts of questions, but am particularly interested in the impact of global change on the ecological processes that shape plant populations and communities. I use functional traits as tools to understand the mechanisms that drive plant responses to the environment, as well as to make predictions and draw conclusions about plant responses that are generalizable across species. I\u0026rsquo;m also excited about exploring new statistical and computational techniques to analyze and communicate ecological data. You can find more about my research projects here.\nHere is my CV\nI grew up in Wyoming and Montana, and barring a four-year stint in western Massachussetts for undergrad, have lived in the Mountain West ever since. I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about conservation and management, particularly of our sprawling Western North-American landscapes, and especially enjoy thinking and learning about creative stewardship practices that recognize the necessary coexistence between human and non-human worlds.\nI feel very fortunate to have grown up in a place with such tremendous access to the outdoors, and for having a family and community that encouraged recreating in and learning about the natural world. As I\u0026rsquo;m sure is common with many ecologists, I can trace my interest in science and natural history directly to my early experiences outside. I care a lot about expanding access to the outdoors and exposure to field science, particularly for young people, so that every kid has the opportunity to learn about and be fascinated by nature. These experiences are transformative, and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be limited to those of us who are lucky enough to live with mountains, prairies, or streams in our back yard.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not doing science, I\u0026rsquo;m likely doing one of the following:\n hanging out with my dog skiing in the backcountry as much as possible riding a mountain bike (and very occassionally a road bike, as long as the Wyoming wind isn\u0026rsquo;t howling too hard) botanizing trail running, climbing, hiking, hammocking, or really anything else outside eating and cooking tasty food knitting, sewing, or making other things by hand  If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in my non-science endeavors and want to find out more, click here.\n",
