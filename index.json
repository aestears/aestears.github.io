I am a plant ecologist excited about all sorts of plant and ecological questions, but am particularly interested the impact of global change on ecological processes in plant populations and communities. I use functional traits as tools to understand the mechanisms underlying plant responses to the environment, as well as to make predictions and draw conclusions about plant responses that aren\u0026rsquo;t restricted by taxonomy.\nHere is my CV\n",
