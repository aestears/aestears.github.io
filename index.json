I am a plant ecologist excited about all sorts of plant and ecological questions, but am particularly interested the impact of global change on ecological processes in plant populations and communities. I use functional traits as tools to understand the mechanisms underlying plant responses to the environment, as well as to make predictions and draw conclusions about plant responses that are generalizable across taxanomic groups.\nHere is my CV\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not doing science, I\u0026rsquo;m likely doing one of the following:\n hanging out with my dog skiing in the backcountry as much as possible mountain biking trail running, hiking, hammocking, really anything else outside eating and cooking food knitting, sewing, or making other things by hand  If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in my non-science endeavors, and for some reason want to find out more, click here.\n",

I hope you find something interesting, useful, or entertaining!\n hanging out with my dog skiing in the backcountry as much as possible mountain biking trail running, hiking, hammocking, really anything else outside eating and cooking food knitting, sewing, or making other things by hand  ",
