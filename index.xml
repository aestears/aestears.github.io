      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.
Set up RStudio Cloud Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). I want you to be able to work from your own laptop in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.</description>

      <description>Overleaf 101 Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor that has a lot of great features including simultaneous editing by multiple authors, simple commenting and track changes, and excellent built-in version control. It is a bit different than Microsoft Word or Google Docs, but not by much! Here is a quick overview to help you figure out how (and why) to navigate and contribute to documents written on Overleaf.

      <title>plantTracker is published on CRAN!</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Here! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share that plantTracker, an R package that I created as part of my PhD dissertation, is available to download from CRAN!
plantTracker provides several user-friendly functions that extract growth, survival, and competition information from repeatedly-sampled, fine-scale maps of organism occurence. We created these functions specifically to get competition and demographic data from repeatedly-mapped quadrats of perennial plants, but are excited for folks to come up with all sorts of creative applications for these functions!</description>
