      <description>I am currently a Postdoctoral research associate at the University of Wyoming as part of both the Weiss-Lehman lab group and the Modelscape collaborative. I recieved my PhD in Ecology from the University of Wyoming in the Program in Ecology and Evolution and the Botany Department, where I worked with Dr. Daniel Laughlin.
I&amp;rsquo;m a plant ecologist excited about all sorts of questions, but am particularly interested in the impact of global change on the ecological processes that shape plant populations and communities.</description>

      <description>plantTracker is an R package to transform fine-scale maps of plant occurrence into demographic data that can be used for further analysis. You can find a lot more information about plantTracker here</description>

      <description>Trait-mediated demographic response to drought in the Colorado shortgrass steppe A major goal in ecology is to make generalizable predictions of organism responses to environmental variation based on their traits. However, straightforward relationships between traits and fitness are rare and likely vary with environmental context. Characterizing how traits mediate demographic responses to the environment may enhance predictions of organism responses to global change. In this project, we synthesized 15 years of demographic data and species-level traits in a shortgrass steppe to determine whether the effects of leaf and root traits on growth and survival depend on seasonal water availability.</description>

      <description>Science is, of course, fun, but I also enjoy a lot of other pursuits. I also think it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly important to acknowledge that doing science is a job, and even if it is fulfilling and interesting, it&amp;rsquo;s so valuable and necessary to celebrate and prioritize the other elements of our lives as well.
This page includes links and information about various non-science topics. I hope you find something interesting, useful, or entertaining!</description>
