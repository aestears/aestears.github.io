      <description>I am a PhD candidate in Ecology at the University of Wyoming in the Program in Ecology and the Botany Department. I&amp;rsquo;m a plant ecologist excited about all sorts of questions, but am particularly interested in the impact of global change on the ecological processes that shape plant populations and communities. I use functional traits as tools to understand the mechanisms that drive plant responses to the environment, as well as to make predictions and draw conclusions about plant responses that are generalizable across species.</description>
