Pre-Workshop To-Do We&amp;rsquo;re so excited to talk and learn about git, GitHub and R Studio with you on April 14th! In order to streamline the interactive part of the workshop, here are a few tasks you should complete before our meeting. I bet many of you have already completed at least a few of them, so it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take long to finish the list!</description>
